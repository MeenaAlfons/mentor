# react

This project holds questions and examples to probe mentees and get them to inspect and expand their understanding of react.

**How does a react app become a web page?**

This questions aims at understanding what is JSX and React under the hood and how they become a web page eventually.

Examples 1 to 8 build the same web pages in various ways:
- bare html
- bare js
- using jsx without react. 
- using react without jsx
- using both jsx and react.

including examples for both bundling libraries in output file and using standalone links for application and libraries.

**If JSX can be used without React? Then why do we use React? What does React provide other than creating dom elements from js?**

The first question revealed the fact that web pages can be built using Javascript, or using JSX, without the need for React. Then what is react?
The answer to this quesiton is left as an exercise to the reader.

Hint: [Reacting](https://react.dev/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state#:~:text=React%20was%20built%20to%20solve%20this%20problem.) :)

**What is server-side rendering and how is it different than client-side rendering?**

This is another relevant quesiton that builds on the previous one.

**So what? What situations should I use SSR for and what situations should I avoid SSR for?**

This questions is about evaluation and decision making. The previous two quesitons was about understanding how things work and contrasting different approaches.
The answer to this quesiton is left as an exercise to the reader.
